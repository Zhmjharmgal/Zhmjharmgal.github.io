This is Mingjun Zhou's home on the web!

I am currently a 4-th year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science
and Engineering (CSE) in The Chinese University of Hong Kong
([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html)), supervised by [Prof.
Chi-Wing FU, Philip](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/). I obtained my
Bachelor's degree from the same university (CUHK). I currently work on computer
graphics, especially on the generation of various LEGO assemblies.
